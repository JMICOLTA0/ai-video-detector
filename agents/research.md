- ⚠️ Requires sales contact for pricing

### For Production Scale

**Hybrid Approach Recommended**:

1. **Primary API**: Arya.ai for real-time processing
2. **Backup API**: Hive for high-confidence verification
3. **Open-source fallback**: TrueMedia.org models for cost optimization
4. **Ensemble method**: Combine multiple detectors for higher accuracy

### For Custom Development

**Pre-trained Model Options**:
1. **TrueMedia.org ML Models** (request access for weights)
2. **EfficientNetB7 fine-tuned on DFDC** (87.98% accuracy)
3. **Vision Transformer implementation** (97% validation accuracy)

**Benefits**:
- Full control over processing
- No per-request costs after setup
- Customizable for specific use cases
- Can handle 300MB file limit easily

### File Size Handling Strategy

Since most APIs don't specify file size limits clearly:

1. **Pre-processing**: Implement video compression/optimization for files >100MB
2. **Chunking**: Split longer videos into segments for analysis
3. **Format optimization**: Convert to MP4 H.264 for best compatibility
4. **Fallback processing**: Use asynchronous APIs (like Deepware) for larger files

### Cost Optimization

**Development Phase**:
- Start with TrueMedia.org (free)
- Use Arya.ai pay-per-use for testing
- Evaluate Eden AI for model comparison

**Production Phase**:
- Negotiate volume pricing with Arya.ai/Hive
- Implement caching for repeated content
- Consider hybrid model (API + open-source) for cost efficiency

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Contact Arya.ai for detailed pricing and file size limits
2. **Parallel**: Request access to TrueMedia.org model weights
3. **Evaluation**: Set up test accounts with 2-3 APIs for comparison
4. **Architecture**: Design system to support multiple API backends
5. **Compliance**: Ensure chosen solution meets data privacy requirements
